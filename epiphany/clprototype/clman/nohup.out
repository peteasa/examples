15 A copy of this edition belonged to Sir Thomas Hanmer, though he does

4

16 not appear to have mentioned it in his notes to Shakespeare or in his

17 correspondence, and its existence was not known till his library came

4

18 into the possession of Sir E. H. Bunbury in 1821. In a copy of the

4

4
next
23 in existence was found by me in the Library at Barton when it came

4
next
24 into my possession in 1821. The Hamlet was bound up with ten others of

4
next
25 the small 4to editions of Shakespeare's Plays (1598 to 1603) and with

4
next
26 The Two Noble Kinsmen (1634). Most of these were complete. I sold the

4
next
27 volume in Dec. 1824 for £180 to Messrs Payne and Foss, who resold it to

4
next
28 the Duke of Devonshire for £230.'
